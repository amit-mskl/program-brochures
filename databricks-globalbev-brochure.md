# Databricks Data Engineering: Solve GlobalBev's Real Production Challenges

## 🎯 The Real Challenge

**Meet GlobalBev**, a rapidly growing e-commerce startup drowning in data chaos:

*"Our ETL pipeline keeps failing silently. Customer data is inconsistent across systems. We're paying $50k/month to process 20GB of data that should take 10 minutes. Our CEO doesn't trust our inventory reports anymore. Sound familiar?"*

This isn't a theoretical program—you'll step into GlobalBev's shoes and solve the **exact same production challenges** that cripple growing companies. Every problem you face has been pulled directly from real enterprise environments.

## 🔥 **1. What Data Engineering Problems Will You Solve?**

### **GlobalBev's Data Quality Crisis**
- **"Our customer phone numbers are in 4 different formats"** → Build standardization pipelines that handle messy real-world data
- **"Orders table shows products manufactured AFTER they were sold"** → Implement data validation rules that catch impossible scenarios  
- **"JSON nutritional data is nested 3 levels deep and breaking our reports"** → Master flattening semi-structured data for analytics

### **Performance & Scale Disasters**
- **"Processing 20GB takes 3 hours, but CEO wants reports in 10 minutes"** → Learn broadcast joins, column pruning, and caching that cut runtime by 90%
- **"Small files are everywhere - 15,000 files of 2MB each"** → Master OPTIMIZE and Z-ORDER commands that consolidate files and speed queries
- **"Memory spills to disk are killing our clusters"** → Configure cluster memory settings and tune Spark parameters for optimal performance

### **Real-Time Processing Challenges**  
- **"Inventory updates from warehouse API arrive unpredictably"** → Build fault-tolerant streaming pipelines using Databricks Autoloader
- **"API sometimes returns partial data or fails completely"** → Implement retry logic, circuit breakers, and graceful degradation strategies
- **"We need inventory alerts within 5 minutes of stockouts"** → Create real-time monitoring with Delta Live Tables and streaming analytics

### **Security & Compliance Nightmares**
- **"We're storing customer emails and addresses in plain text"** → Implement dynamic data masking and column-level security with Unity Catalog
- **"Compliance team needs complete audit trails of data access"** → Build comprehensive logging and lineage tracking
- **"Different teams need different access levels to the same data"** → Master role-based access control and data governance frameworks

### **DevOps & Deployment Chaos**
- **"Our notebooks are scattered across 12 different workspaces"** → Implement GitOps workflows with proper branching strategies and CI/CD pipelines
- **"Code changes break production without warning"** → Build pre-commit hooks, unit testing, and automated quality checks
- **"We can't deploy the same code across dev/test/prod environments"** → Master environment configuration and secrets management

### **Cost & Resource Optimization**
- **"Our Azure bill jumped from $5k to $50k without explanation"** → Learn cluster autoscaling, spot instance strategies, and cost monitoring
- **"Developers spin up massive clusters for tiny datasets"** → Implement resource governance and intelligent cluster sizing
- **"We're paying for compute that runs 24/7 but processes data for 2 hours"** → Master auto-termination and serverless architectures

## 🧠 **2. What Core Data Engineering Concepts Will You Master?**

*These concepts emerge naturally as you solve GlobalBev's real problems—no abstract theory, just practical knowledge when you desperately need it.*

### **Medallion Architecture in Action**
- **Bronze Layer Challenges** → Handle schema evolution when GlobalBev's PostgreSQL adds new columns without warning
- **Silver Layer Data Quality** → Clean address formats, standardize phone numbers, and validate business rules
- **Gold Layer Analytics** → Build `fact_sku_market_performance` tables that executives actually trust and use

### **Delta Lake Operations That Matter**
- **Incremental Processing** → Use MERGE INTO and Change Data Feed to process only what's changed, not entire datasets
- **Time Travel & Recovery** → When someone accidentally deletes customer data, roll back to any point in time
- **Schema Evolution** → Handle new JSON fields from APIs without breaking downstream consumers

### **Performance Engineering That Works**
- **Query Optimization** → Transform joins that scan 15GB into targeted lookups that finish in seconds
- **Cluster Sizing** → Right-size compute for 20GB workloads vs 500GB workloads without overpaying
- **Caching Strategies** → Cache dimension tables that get joined repeatedly, slash compute costs by 60%

### **Production Data Quality**
- **Data Validation** → Catch manufacturing dates that are after order dates before they corrupt reports
- **Error Handling** → Process partial API responses gracefully instead of failing the entire pipeline
- **Testing Strategies** → Write pytest functions that verify phone number standardization actually works

### **Enterprise Security & Governance**
- **PII Protection** → Mask customer emails in dev/test while keeping production access for authorized users
- **Access Control** → Finance team sees payment data, marketing team sees demographic data, nobody sees everything
- **Compliance Automation** → Generate audit reports that satisfy SOX, GDPR, and industry regulations

## 🛠 **3. What Core Data Engineering Skills Will You Develop?**

*These skills develop through solving GlobalBev's production fires, with expert mentorship when you're stuck.*

### **Production Troubleshooting**
- **Debug Spark UI** → Identify why joins are spilling to disk and fix memory configuration
- **Analyze query plans** → Spot expensive operations and optimize them before they hit production
- **Handle data skew** → Redistribute uneven data that causes some tasks to run 10x longer than others
- **Monitor pipeline health** → Set up alerts that catch failures before executives notice missing reports

### **Real-World Pipeline Engineering**
- **Build fault-tolerant ingestion** → Handle warehouse APIs that sometimes return HTTP 500 errors
- **Implement incremental processing** → Process only new/changed records instead of full refreshes
- **Design for schema changes** → Adapt when upstream systems add fields without breaking your pipeline
- **Create reusable components** → Build ingestion functions that work for PostgreSQL, APIs, and CSV files

### **DevOps for Data Teams**
- **Git workflows for data** → Manage notebook versions, resolve merge conflicts, implement feature branches
- **CI/CD pipelines** → Automated testing, linting, and deployment using GitHub Actions
- **Environment management** → Deploy same code to dev/test/prod with different configurations
- **Secret management** → Securely store and rotate database passwords and API keys

### **Performance & Cost Optimization**
- **Cluster configuration** → Choose the right node types and sizes for different workload patterns
- **Resource monitoring** → Track compute usage and optimize for cost without sacrificing performance
- **Data layout optimization** → Partition and cluster tables for query patterns that actually matter
- **Caching strategies** → Know when to cache, what storage level to use, and when to evict

### **Business Communication**
- **Translate tech problems into business impact** → "Schema changes could corrupt revenue reports" instead of "API response format changed"
- **Estimate project timelines** → Factor in testing, deployment, and inevitable production issues
- **Design solution trade-offs** → Balance processing speed vs cost vs complexity for business stakeholders
- **Document decisions** → Write runbooks that the next engineer (or you in 6 months) can actually follow
